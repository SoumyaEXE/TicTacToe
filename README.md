# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Tough AI

This is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that includes an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm. The AI is designed to be tough, making it hard to win for the player.

## Features
- Player vs AI Tic-Tac-Toe.
- The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to play optimally.
- Highlights winning cells and declares the winner or draw.
- AI aims to win as early as possible and delay losses.

## Game Mechanics
- Player chooses to play as either **X** or **O**.
- The game board is a 3x3 grid.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## How to Play
1. Choose your player (X or O).
2. Take turns placing your mark on the grid.
3. The AI will automatically make its move after yours.
4. The game will declare a winner or draw once conditions are met.
